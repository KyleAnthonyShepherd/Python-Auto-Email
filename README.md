# Python-Auto-Email

Python email sender, with attachments.<br/>

This code can automatically send emails from your address to any given address.<br/>
It can also attach files to the email.<br/>

The primary purpose of this script is to send an email to a friend with an <br/>
attached music file. Using .bat files and task scheduler, a daily email can be <br/>
sent to your friend without any intervention required on your part. <br/>
You will need to replace my email and the dummied out password for your email <br/>
and password for the code to work. <br/>
Currently only works out of the box for gmail addresses. <br/>
[Your computer does need to be on and connected to the internet for this to work] <br/>
[But this code could easily run on an always on raspberry pi, or an Amazon <br/>
server if need be] <br/>
